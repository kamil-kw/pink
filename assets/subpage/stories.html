                    II am 62 years old. Following a routine Mammogram, I was recalled for a second screening. 
                    I knew when this appointment arrived there was an issue. I had to prepare myself psychologically and try to think positive. 
                    I reminded myself that my Mother had a mastectomy at 57 years old and she is now 88. </h3></div>
                <div class="story-body"><h3>
                    I had a lumpectomy, precancerous tissue and 4 lymph nodes removed for analysis. Diagnosis was invasive carcinoma, categorised as ER/HER-2 positive.
                    The surgery was a success, lymph nodes were clear so the cancer had not spread. I am now waiting for an appointment with the 
                    oncologist to plan my Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy as a preventative measure. I was expecting to have Radiotherapy but not 
                    Chemo which was another shock but it’s necessary because of the aggressive form of cancer I had.

                <div class="story-body"><h3> 
                    My advice would be to attend your Mammogram appointments, which in Ireland occur routinely every two years for women over 50. 
                    My diagnosis was at an early stage, the tumour measured less than three centimetres. I cannot speak highly enough of the team 
                    at the Breast Cancer Clinic on Eccles Street, Dublin. That is where I had my second Mammograms, biopsies, magseed procedure, 
                    ultrasound and met my surgeon. Each department there showed care, kindness and understanding. I received a phone number I could 
                    ring if I needed any advice or questions answered before my next appointment. Also the McGivney wing and Operating Theatre in the Mater 
                    hospital where I had my surgery. They made what was quite a traumatic experience more manageable and I thank them all.
                </h3></div>
                <div class="story-body"><h3> 
                    It helps that I have such confidence in the experts treating me and the advice and care they give. They help you to think positively 
                    which is important. For me going out for walks, having a small restoration project to concentrate on or craftwork, whatever you’re interested in,
                    painting, gardening etc. Something you can return to again and again when you feel able during treatment.

                <div class="story-body"><h3>
                    Do the exercises recommended post-surgery, they will be a little difficult at the start but they definitely work to get shoulder and arm movement back.
                    I received Emmett Technique from my sister, which is a very gentle muscle release therapy using light touch. I can highly recommend 
                    this to ease discomfort, relax the body and improve body movement. I have had this therapy many times before. It is very gentle and very effective.

                    I am so lucky to have such a supportive family for which I will be eternally grateful, they have helped me in every way possible
