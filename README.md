## Do frequent TLC (touch, look, check)

Get used to the feeling of your breast, this will allow you to detect the early stages of the breast cancers.
Each breast might have a different feeling, however there are general signs, which should be alarming for you. To find out more about it click here

* CLICK here would have a page where different signs are shown and explain
* Consider adding the page for family and friends of how to support fight with cancer.
* One page with explanation of TLC maybe connected with signs of cancer

 

Do not talk only about female breast cancer, rare (but possible) male could develop chest cancer too.

Perhaps is good to call it on CLICK here page -> breast/ chest cancer.
