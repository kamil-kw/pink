## Objective

As a main goal of this project is raise a Breast Cancer Awareness, provide informations to the external pages, as well to give a good word and share stories of our users with wide audience.

## Brief

As a name of the team and the main theme we choose to create an acronym from a word PINK which states *PINK Is the New Kindness*:

**P**ink

**N**ew

**K**indness

It's all about kindness to surrounding members of your family friends world and what the most important to yourself, therefore our motto is "be kind": 

* Be kind to **yourself** ‚Äì detection of early breast cancer signs, give you a great chance of winning this fight. Believe in your strength!
* Be kind to **family & friends** ‚Äì they need you in their lives, and they will be there for you.

## UX Design

User Experience Design

The goal of this website is to provide resources for users on how they can best support themselves, their friends and family, and the wider community, who have been affected by Breast cancer.

It will collate external resources for each of these three parts (individual, friends/family, world) so the user can easily find information depending on their personal situation. 

There will also be stories shared from the community and a form that allows a user to submit their own personal experience.

## UX Design (Esteph)

Breast cancer, or any type of cancer, can be daunting and sometimes devastating. With this in mind, PINK needed to be a place that was warm, happy and inviting. A space where users feel welcomed but also catches their attention. Additionally, as kindness underpins the values for this project, we wanted to ensure this was reflected in our UX. We‚Äôve achieved this through our selective use of colours, light-hearted imagery, icons and fonts. 

The overall aesthetic is clean, modern and ‚Äúlight‚Äù. Where often finding information online about breast cancer can be overwhelming, we wanted PINK to be clean and clear for the user. A place where information isn‚Äôt in your face, but gently handed to you.

#### Colour Palette:

The prominent colour is pink, as pink is not only the name of the project, but also the symbol for breast cancer awareness and it was important to respect this association. Along with the colour pink, we created a custom colour palette which not only compliments the imagery throughout the website, but connotes the feeling of kindness, happiness and hope. 

![colour palette](assets/images/readme/colour-palette.jpg)

#### Fonts:

To keep within the theme and overall aesthetic, we decided for the below fonts which are used throughout the site: 

Monsterrat Bold - header and subtitles

Monsterrat regular - copy text 

#### Imagery:

We have used light-heart and tongue-and-cheek imagery throughout the site as we wanted to steer clear from any feeling of being too clinical or ‚Äúserious‚Äù. Breast cancer can be a heavy topic for the user, by implementing these light-hearted images we hope to create a bit of fun for the user and lift a little bit of that weight and worry.

### User Requirements

Some example user stories which will affect the design: 

* I want to educate myself and understand how and what I should check myself for
* I want to learn how I can support friends and family that are going through a bereavement
* I want to find out how I can help someone going through a diagnosis or treatment
* I want to learn how I can support myself through a bereavement
* I want to find out how I can help the wider reasearch of cancer treatments and preventative action
* I want to find ideas on how I can raise money for cancer charities
* I want to read stories of those with similar experiences
* I want to share my own expereinces with the community

### Landing page:
Being the first page the user lands on, we wanted the landing page to be welcoming as well as visually impactful to the user. We achieved this through keeping it simple yet effective with the use of our tongue-and-cheek hero image which is placed centrally across the screen. The name of the project is also placed centrally on the screen in large and bold letters to shout our name out load and proud. The slogan below the hero image also tells the user what the project name stands for clearly so the user knows what to expect.

## Bugs

### Current

<!-- - bugOne explanation

### Resolved

1.	Scale JavaScript/CSS

We have made a scale transition so that on hover, any element with the class 'scale' enlarges by 20% and changes background color. On testing on a separate branch, it worked but after merging with the main branch it stopped. Testing in the console showed the correct element was picked up and reviewing the code showed it was logical. Post merge we found it worked ‚Äì there may have been a delay in it going through to the live site! 


2.	Fade JavaScript 

We have added a fade in on scroll. The initial code was built so that an object faded in when the whole element was in the window as per the below code:

    $(document).ready(function () {
        /* Every time the window is scrolled ... */
        $(window).scroll(function () {
            /* Check the location of each desired element */
            $(".fade").each( function() {
                
                let bottom_of_object = $(this).offset().top + $(this).outerHeight();
                let bottom_of_window = $(window).scrollTop() + $(window).height();

                /* If the object is completely visible in the window, fade it it */
                if( bottom_of_window > bottom_of_object ){
                    
                    $(this).animate({'opacity':'1'}, 1000);
                }
            }); 
        });
    }); 


However on testing we thorught that this looked like it was loading the page too slowly and it did not give the effect we wanted. We changed this so that it fades in on enter and at a faster screen. We have gone with this code and taken out the need for the whole element to be above the bottom of the screen: 

    $(document).ready(function () {
        /* Every time the window is scrolled ... */
        $(window).scroll(function () {
            // Check the location of each desired element with a fade class */
            $(".fade").each( function() {
                // fade in
                $(this).animate({'opacity':'1'}, 2000);
            }); 
        });
    });

3.	Back to Top Link 

This was a typo in that the <i> element from font-awesome wasn‚Äôt copied correctly. 

It was corrected from:

    <div class="col-12 scroll">
        <a href="#" class="fas fa-chevron-up">
          Back to Top
        </a>
    </div>

To:

    <div class="col-12 scroll">
      <a href="#"><i class="fas fa-chevron-up"></i>
        Back to Top
      </a>
    </div>


4.	Intro Section and colour change on headers

When adding the introduction paragraph and image, we found that it conflicted with the landing page and pushed the h3 sub-heading out when on a desktop screen. 

To counter this, we added padding to the top and edited the background-colour to match the landing page so that the transition is smooth and unnoticed as below. 

    .intro {
        padding: 100px 40px;
        font-size: 1.2rem;
        background-color: #DDC0C8;
      }
